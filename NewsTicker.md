## Bitcoin Spike Fueled by Short Squeeze as Market Shrugs Off Tether News
Bitcoin market analysts are speculating over what fueled the cryptocurrency’s price jump on Monday, and some of the experts say a short squeeze of heavily leveraged traders may have added to upward pressure on prices.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have risen dramatically over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was trading at $39,189 at press time, for a 15% price gain. 

Short liquidations – bearish trades where the principal was wiped out due to margin calls – kicked in around 9 p.m. ET time Sunday, helping to improve market sentiment and pushing the price of BTC up, according to Laurent Kssis, global head of exchange-traded products at 21Shares AG.
